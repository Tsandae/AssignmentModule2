Module 2 Assignment: Salary Function 

## Project Overview
This project processes employee salary data and allows users to retrieve details of specific employees by name. The project involves importing salary data, processing it using Python, exporting employee details to a CSV file, and then zipping the file for submission. Additionally, an R script is provided to unzip the file and display the data.

## Files Included
1. **Employee_Profile.zip**:
   - A zipped folder containing employee profile details in CSV format. Each CSV file contains information about an employee retrieved by the Python function.
   
2. **Employee_Profile/NATHANIEL_FORD_details.csv** (example CSV):
   - This CSV file contains details for the employee "Nathaniel Ford" and serves as an example. Multiple CSVs can be generated for other employees using the same method.

3. **AssignmentModule2.ipynb** (Jupyter Notebook):
   - This notebook contains the Python code used to process the salary data, retrieve employee details, and export them as CSV files.

4. **AssignmentModule2.R** (R script):
   - This script unzips the `Employee_Profile.zip` file and displays the employee profile CSVs in R.
